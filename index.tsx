*   **Doesn't live in the sea:** They are found in freshwater rivers and streams in eastern Australia and Tasmania.
*   **Venomous:** This is the most unique clue for a mammal. Male platypuses possess a venomous spur on their hind legs, which can inflict considerable pain on humans and be lethal to smaller animals.
*   **Smaller than a cat:** An adult platypus typically ranges from 30 to 45 cm (12-18 inches) in body length, plus a tail, and weighs between 0.7 to 2.4 kg (1.5-5.3 lbs), which is generally smaller than an average domestic cat.
